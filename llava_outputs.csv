The floor is a light gray color, and there are several long tables with chairs arranged in rows, suggesting a classroom or lecture hall setting. The tables and chairs are mostly white, with some black accents.

On the left side of the image, there is a row of tables and chairs that are currently unoccupied. The tables are long and narrow, and the chairs are stackable, indicating that the room is designed for flexibility in seating arrangements.

In the center of the room, there is a large, rectangular screen mounted on the wall, which could be used for presentations or video conferencing. The screen is turned off in the image.

On the right side of the room, there is a counter with a sink and a mirror, which might be used for handwashing or other hygiene purposes.

The ceiling is fitted with recessed lighting, and there are no visible windows or other sources of natural light. The walls are painted in a light color, and there are no visible decorations or artwork.

There are no people visible in the image, and the room appears to be empty. The overall atmosphere is one of a quiet, empty space, possibly awaiting use.","{'chair_1': [[2, 287, 255, 677]], 'chair_2': [[224, 259, 318, 357]], 'dining_table_1': [[0, 349, 154, 422]], 'television_set_1': [[803, 218, 888, 282]], 'dining_table_2': [[1170, 366, 1279, 428]], 'lightbulb_1': [[820, 0, 846, 24]], 'lightbulb_2': [[806, 119, 820, 134]], 'lightbulb_3': [[682, 74, 699, 101]], 'lightbulb_4': [[826, 93, 844, 112]], 'lightbulb_5': [[668, 139, 681, 158]], 'lightbulb_6': [[694, 23, 714, 59]], 'lightbulb_7': [[589, 104, 604, 128]], 'lightbulb_8': [[674, 113, 689, 135]], 'lightbulb_9': [[427, 40, 458, 75]], 'painting_1': [[632, 315, 653, 359]], 'lightbulb_10': [[653, 216, 660, 224]], 'lightbulb_11': [[664, 160, 676, 176]], 'lightbulb_12': [[752, 114, 767, 135]], 'chair_3': [[158, 260, 194, 295]], 'chair_4': [[556, 316, 583, 366]], 'lightbulb_13': [[583, 60, 600, 90]], 'lightbulb_14': [[593, 137, 606, 158]], 'lightbulb_15': [[653, 222, 659, 231]], 'lightbulb_16': [[739, 139, 753, 152]], 'dining_table_3': [[449, 315, 539, 409]], 'lightbulb_17': [[661, 178, 670, 190]], 'lightbulb_18': [[1020, 82, 1036, 97]], 'lightbulb_19': [[463, 95, 488, 122]], 'lightbulb_20': [[846, 123, 862, 136]], 'lightbulb_21': [[489, 134, 508, 155]], 'chair_5': [[1253, 360, 1280, 428]], 'chair_6': [[543, 316, 579, 380]], 'painting_2': [[368, 206, 401, 303]], 'lightbulb_22': [[508, 163, 526, 181]], 'chair_7': [[224, 260, 321, 457]], 'lightbulb_23': [[596, 162, 607, 177]], 'lightbulb_24': [[852, 58, 875, 81]], 'lightbulb_25': [[1022, 141, 1044, 155]], 'lightbulb_26': [[419, 188, 441, 204]], 'lightbulb_27': [[445, 207, 462, 219]], 'lightbulb_28': [[657, 192, 667, 204]], 'lightbulb_29': [[575, 0, 593, 34]], 'lightbulb_30': [[1024, 7, 1048, 30]], 'lightbulb_31': [[599, 182, 610, 194]], 'lightbulb_32': [[648, 236, 654, 244]], 'lightbulb_33': [[555, 236, 565, 244]], 'lightbulb_34': [[522, 184, 537, 200]], 'pole_1': [[758, 7, 815, 411]], 'lightbulb_35': [[533, 201, 546, 214]], 'lightbulb_36': [[1066, 175, 1090, 187]], 'chair_8': [[528, 315, 564, 391]], 'dining_table_4': [[455, 316, 530, 328]], 'painting_3': [[631, 295, 667, 310]], 'lightbulb_37': [[183, 5, 236, 48]], 'chair_9': [[148, 261, 193, 350]]}","You are given with a JSON-like description of the scene.

In the foreground, there is a long table with a wooden top and metal legs, which is positioned parallel to the camera. Behind the table, there are several chairs with wheels, suggesting they are part of a mobile workstation setup. The chairs are arranged in a row, facing the table.

To the left of the table, there is a tall, cylindrical column with a metallic finish, which adds to the industrial aesthetic of the room. On the right side of the table, there is a large, rectangular screen mounted on the wall, which is turned off.

The room has a series of windows with a reflective surface, possibly glass, allowing natural light to enter. The walls are painted in a light color, and there are no visible decorations or artwork.

/mnt/vol0/datasets/rosbag2_navigation_for_graph_21_feb_2024/rgb_images/00855.jpg,"The image shows an interior space that appears to be a large, open room with a high ceiling. The floor is a light color, possibly concrete, and there are no visible obstructions. The room is well-lit, with a combination of natural light coming from windows not visible in the image and artificial lighting from recessed ceiling lights.

In the foreground, there are several rows of tables and chairs, suggesting that this space is used for meetings or events. The tables are black and the chairs are white, with some having a metallic finish. The tables are arranged in a way that allows for multiple seating arrangements, and there are no people visible in the room.

In the background, there is a large, curved wall that seems to be part of the building's architecture. The wall is white and has a smooth finish. On the right side of the image, there is a column that supports the ceiling, and the column is painted in a dark color, possibly gray or black.

The overall impression is of a modern, spacious room designed for group activities or presentations. The absence of people and the neat arrangement of the furniture suggest that the space is currently not in use.","{'lightbulb_1': [[684, 159, 696, 174]], 'chair_1': [[231, 308, 268, 358]], 'lightbulb_2': [[576, 74, 594, 93]], 'lightbulb_3': [[679, 135, 692, 154]], 'lightbulb_4': [[756, 137, 772, 158]], 'lightbulb_5': [[673, 106, 688, 130]], 'lightbulb_6': [[859, 138, 881, 162]], 'lightbulb_7': [[666, 69, 683, 96]], 'poster_1': [[429, 282, 460, 327]], 'lightbulb_8': [[552, 25, 575, 56]], 'poster_2': [[584, 352, 601, 374]], 'chair_2': [[830, 311, 893, 421]], 'lightbulb_9': [[762, 103, 779, 129]], 'lightbulb_10': [[657, 16, 675, 51]], 'chair_3': [[775, 340, 795, 391]], 'lightbulb_11': [[456, 0, 480, 23]], 'lightbulb_12': [[770, 56, 790, 89]], 'lightbulb_13': [[529, 87, 538, 99]], 'lightbulb_14': [[690, 190, 701, 205]], 'poster_3': [[584, 314, 602, 336]], 'cabinet_1': [[0, 268, 21, 334]], 'cabinet_2': [[20, 270, 54, 337]], 'lightbulb_15': [[903, 218, 921, 231]], 'lightbulb_16': [[824, 190, 843, 207]], 'lightbulb_17': [[806, 221, 820, 232]], 'chair_4': [[140, 302, 187, 369]], 'lightbulb_18': [[884, 100, 911, 129]], 'lightbulb_19': [[925, 200, 951, 217]], 'lightbulb_20': [[815, 207, 829, 220]], 'lightbulb_21': [[1065, 103, 1093, 127]], 'chair_5': [[138, 302, 187, 333]], 'lightbulb_22': [[753, 163, 766, 181]], 'lightbulb_23': [[688, 175, 699, 190]], 'lightbulb_24': [[867, 242, 882, 253]], 'person_1': [[685, 315, 707, 366]], 'lightbulb_25': [[921, 41, 952, 77]], 'lightbulb_26': [[839, 168, 859, 188]], 'lightbulb_27': [[855, 252, 868, 261]], 'bench_1': [[116, 322, 186, 374]], 'cabinet_3': [[52, 273, 94, 331]], 'lightbulb_28': [[535, 271, 545, 279]], 'lightbulb_29': [[830, 270, 839, 276]], 'lightbulb_30': [[958, 177, 986, 195]], 'lightbulb_31': [[567, 283, 574, 290]], 'chair_6': [[775, 339, 824, 393]], 'lightbulb_32': [[886, 232, 900, 242]], 'lightbulb_33': [[552, 278, 562, 286]], 'lightbulb_34': [[623, 285, 628, 291]], 'chair_7': [[406, 335, 427, 361]], 'lightbulb_35': [[749, 183, 762, 198]], 'lightbulb_36': [[527, 285, 536, 291]], 'trash_can_1': [[685, 338, 703, 365]], 'lightbulb_37': [[1001, 144, 1038, 168]], 'lightbulb_38': [[783, 0, 803, 28]], 'lightbulb_39': [[798, 232, 811, 241]], 'chair_8': [[982, 440, 1130, 584]], 'lightbulb_40': [[813, 283, 821, 290]], 'lightbulb_41': [[844, 259, 857, 268]]}","You are given with a JSON-like description of the scene.

Beyond the barrier, there is a row of tables and chairs, suggesting a dining or meeting area. The tables and chairs are arranged in a straight line, and there are no people seated at them.

The middle ground of the image shows a series of columns that support the ceiling, which is fitted with recessed lighting. The lighting creates a bright and even illumination throughout the space.

In the background, there is a large window that allows natural light to enter the room. The window is framed by a white structure that could be part of the building's architecture.

The office is characterized by a modern design with a high ceiling and large windows that allow natural light to flood the space. The floor is covered with a dark gray carpet, and the walls are painted white, creating a bright and airy atmosphere.

In the foreground, there is a desk with a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. The desk appears to be equipped for office work. To the left of the desk, there is a black office chair with wheels, suggesting it is designed for ergonomic use.

In the background, there is a long corridor with a series of desks and office chairs. The desks are equipped with computer monitors, keyboards, and mice, indicating that they are workstations. The chairs are modern and appear to be adjustable.

The corridor is flanked by large windows that allow for ample natural light to enter the space. The windows are reflective, suggesting they are made of glass.

On the right side of the image, there is a glass door that leads to another room. The door is transparent, allowing a view of the room beyond.

There are no people visible in the image, and the overall impression is of an empty office space during a time when it is not in use. There are no visible obstacles in the immediate vicinity, and the office appears to be well-organized and clean.","{'chair_1': [[155, 309, 328, 591]], 'monitor_(computer_equipment) computer_monitor_1': [[247, 248, 382, 357]], 'straw_(for_drinking)_1': [[328, 303, 363, 348]], 'monitor_(computer_equipment) computer_monitor_2': [[113, 265, 236, 349]], 'vent_1': [[23, 82, 89, 110]], 'trash_can_1': [[364, 476, 436, 569]], 'trash_can_2': [[0, 644, 186, 719]], 'box_1': [[413, 259, 454, 298]], 'trash_can_3': [[910, 583, 992, 720]], 'dining_table_1': [[0, 401, 273, 593]], 'box_2': [[601, 379, 634, 411]], 'lightbulb_1': [[940, 3, 1057, 80]], 'television_set_1': [[248, 247, 382, 339]], 'dining_table_2': [[0, 400, 275, 495]], 'desk_1': [[290, 358, 490, 572]], 'lightbulb_2': [[564, 232, 570, 241]], 'desk_2': [[0, 346, 168, 404]], 'cup_1': [[356, 344, 383, 366]], 'lightbulb_3': [[630, 271, 638, 277]], 'lightbulb_4': [[558, 2, 581, 184]], 'box_3': [[306, 193, 350, 229]], 'vent_2': [[354, 0, 380, 24]], 'wall_clock_1': [[566, 302, 585, 322]], 'desk_3': [[429, 352, 523, 451]], 'box_4': [[320, 228, 382, 250]], 'chair_2': [[1197, 341, 1280, 717]], 'box_5': [[633, 380, 667, 397]], 'box_6': [[382, 257, 414, 267]], 'lightbulb_5': [[720, 207, 729, 212]], 'monitor_(computer_equipment) computer_monitor_3': [[0, 236, 52, 306]], 'desk_4': [[122, 350, 507, 580]], 'box_7': [[435, 391, 497, 424]], 'chair_3': [[1201, 341, 1280, 518]], 'lightbulb_6': [[4, 2, 152, 100]], 'box_8': [[477, 424, 496, 449]], 'desk_5': [[0, 306, 53, 347]]}","You are given with a JSON-like description of the scene.
